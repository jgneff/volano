<h3>Wrong Applet Version</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>You cannot connect to the chat server because there is a new
version of the client chat applet available from the Web site where
you tried to chat, but your computer is still using the old version
of the applet. Normally, the default settings will pick up the new
version automatically.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Try entering through the chat applet below:</p>

<!-- Note to the chat server administrator:
Replace the codebase attribute in the applet tag below with a new
absolute Web address for this directory so that the new version of the
applet will be loaded through any caching proxy servers. For example,
if your normal codebase is a virtual directory or symbolic link like
the following:

  <applet codebase="http://www.example.com/vcclient" ...

change the codebase to point to a new virtual directory or symbolic
link with the version number included, like this:

  <applet codebase="http://www.example.com/vcclient2.13.0" ...

The modified codebase will force the new chat applet to be loaded
through any caching proxy servers that might otherwise be delivering
the old applet to your Web visitors.
-->

<applet codebase="." archive="COM/volano/VolanoChat.jar" code="COM.volano.VolanoChat.class" width="500" height="60">
<param name="color" value="#ffffff" />
<param name="text" value="english.txt" />
<code>[Enable Java to see the applet here.]</code>
</applet>

<h4>If that didn't work ...</h4>
<p>If entering through the applet on this page didn't work, you can try
deleting the Java Plug-in temporary Internet files, thereby removing
the old version of the applet and forcing the plug-in to load the new
version. Open the Java Control Panel, and on the General tab under
the section Temporary Internet Files, press the Settings... button.
On the Temporary Files Settings window, press the Delete Files...
button. On the Delete Temporary Files window, make sure the
Applications and Applets item is selected with a checkmark, and press
the OK button. Then press the OK buttons on the Temporary Internet
Files Settings window, and then on the Java Control Panel window.
After all that, close your Web browser, restart it, and return to
the Web page where you are trying to chat.</p>

<p>If even that didn't work, you might be trying to do one of the
following (which will not work no matter what you do):</p>

<ul>
<li>trying to enter a personal chat room in a chat server that does
not support hidden personal rooms, or</li>
<li>trying to enter anonymously in a chat server that is restricted
to members only.</li>
</ul>
